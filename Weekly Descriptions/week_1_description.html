		<p class="sub-header">May 3 - May 9</p>
		
		<p class="info">Welcome to the first week of the May Fitness Tournament! This week the main focus is to perform as many repititions as possible. A repitition (or rep for short) is defined as one complete movement. An exercise like a pushup is considered to be one movement, thus doing one pushup is equivalent to one rep. Reps can be any exercise that gets you moving. Examples of possible exercises are jumping jacks, burpees, squats, and toe-touches. It can be difficult to keep track of every repitition you perform during a workout session; it might be helpful to count how many reps you perform in a single minute, then multiply this number by the amount of minutes in your workout.</p>
		<p class="info">This week there will also be extra points awarded for workouts that incorporate stretching. It is important to warm up your muscles before and to stretch them out after a workout to ensure that you don't get hurt. It is recommended for you to stretch before and after a workout, regardless of the particular weeks' scoring system. If you stretch before or after a workout section, that is considered to be a workout that incorporates a stretch.</p>
		<p class="info">The final category that gives you points this week is exercise minutes. This category accounts for any type of exercise, from following along with a workout video to taking a walk around your neighborhood. </p>

		<table>
			<caption>Point Breakdown for Rep Week</caption>
			<tr>
				<th>Category</th>
				<th>Requirements for One Point</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Reps</td>
				<td>20 reps</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Stretching</td>
				<td>One workout that incoporates stretching</td>

		</table>
		
		<p class="info">You should input the amount of reps/workouts with stretches/exercise minutes directly into your team's spreadsheet as shown in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FTjbiu1SHjXmhwCANEiJdvGF8uvXNeZ8CsTgcKNvMqo/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Exemplar</a>. Remember that your workouts can count for more than one category. If you do a 30-minute workout that includes a stretch and 200 miscellaneous repetitions you would earn 12 points for your team (10 points for the reps + a bonus point for stretching + 1 point for the 30 minutes of exercise).</p>
