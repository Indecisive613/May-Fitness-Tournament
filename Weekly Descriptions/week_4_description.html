		<p class="info">Congratulations on making it to the last week of the May Fitness Tournament! To finish things off with a bang, we decided to incorporate point breakdowns from each of the three previous weeks. That means there will be a lot of different ways to earn points, and it will be up to you how you'd like to maximize your points. To make the categories more balanced, the points earned for some of the exercises are different from what was seen in previous weeks.</p>
		<p class="info">The first way to earn points will be through reps. As a reminder, reps are any exercise that gets you moving. To keep track of every repitition you perform during a workout session it is helpful to count how many reps you perform in a single minute, then multiply this number by the amount of minutes in your workout.</p>
		<p class="info">The next way to earn points is through distance. Once again there will be a category for traveling distance on foot, and another for biking/other distance-based excercises that use equipment. You can use the health app or the"Measure Distance" feature on <a href="https://www.google.com/maps" target="_blank">Google Maps</a> to keep track of your distance. </p>
		<p class="info">To ensure that people don't overwork themselves, getting good nights of sleep will once again be worth points. A good night of sleep is considered to be 8 or more hours. Make sure not to neglect your personal health! </p>
		<p class="info">Make sure to keep stretching before and after your workout because incorporating a stretch either before or after your workout is worth an additional point!</p>
		<p class="info">As usual, the last category that can earn points is exercise minutes.</p>

		<p class="info">You should input your fitness information directly into your team's spreadsheet as shown in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tq8GARv8Jq_ZRkxvY3IJ-OYu9JhECaMX-HtMlwseY3Q/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Exemplar</a>. Please enter distance in km and omit writing the units. Remember that your sessions can count for more than one category. If you do a 30-minute workout that includes stretching and 60 repititions, you would earn 4 points for your team (1 points for incoporating a stretch + 2 points for the 60 repititions + 1 point for 30 minutes of exercise).</p>
