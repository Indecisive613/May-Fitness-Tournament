		<p class="main-header">Recovery Week</p>
		<p class="sub-header">May 17 - May 23</p>
		
		<p class="info">You've made it to third week of the May Fitness Tournament! We know you've been working hard these past two weeks, so the theme of this week is recovery! Give your body a break this week by doing lots of stretching and yoga. If you're new to yoga, there are a lot of great videos on YouTube that you can follow. There are also many yoga apps you can download which let you customize your own workout.</p>
		<p class="info">This week will also provide points for water consumption. Hydration is a very important part of fitness as it helps regulate your body temperature, protects sensitive tissues, and lubricates your joints. The water consumption required by each person varies, but in general you should aim for around 8 cups of water a day.</p>
		<p class="info">Another way you can earn points this week is by sleeping. Yes, you read that correctly; you get points for sleeping! Getting a good night of sleep reduces stress, improves memory, and gives you more energy. A good night's sleep is considered to be 8 hours or more. If you follow a healthy sleep schedule, that's an easy 14 points for your team! (2 points for every good night's sleep)</p>
		<p class="info">The last category that can earn points is exercise minutes. Even though the main focus of this week is to recover, this category remains open for those of you who continue to do other types of exercises. Stretching and yoga are considered as exercise, and can count towards this category. Sleeping, however, does not count.</p>

		<table>
			<caption>Point Breakdown for Recovery Week</caption>
			<tr>
				<th>Category</th>
				<th>Requirements for One Point</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Stretching</td>
				<td>5 minutes</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Yoga</td>
				<td>5 minutes</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Water</td>
				<td>0.5 L</td>

			<tr>
				<td>Sleep</td>
				<td>2 points for 8+ hours</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Exercise Minutes</td>
				<td>30 minutes</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
		<p class="info">You should input your recovery information and exercise minutes directly into your team's spreadsheet as shown in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17yMnZE_0H7MDTCSU45RpfxuGKSqsnX7ngKtbxDEW86s/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Exemplar</a>. Please enter water consumption in L and omit writing the units. Remember that your sessions can count for more than one category. If you do a 60-minute workout that includes 15 minutes of stretching you would earn 5 points for your team (3 points for stretching + 2 points for the 60 minutes of exercise).</p>
