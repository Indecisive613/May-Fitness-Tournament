		<p class="info">The objective for the second week of the May Fitness Tournament is to travel as far as possible. Distance can be traveled on foot (walking, jogging, etc.) or by bike. Excercises like roller blading and skateboarding which are performed with a piece of equipment can be counted in the biking category. An easy way to track your distance is through the health app on your phone. If you don't want to carry your phone everywhere, you can also use the "Measure Distance" feature on <a href="https://www.google.com/maps" target="_blank">Google Maps</a> to measure your route.</p>
		<p class="info">This week there will also be extra points awarded for traveling distance outdoors. With such nice weather it would be a shame not to spend as much time as possible outside. Thus for this week, if your distance was traveled outdoors, then double your inputted distance! (1 km of walking outside => 2 km of walking)</p>
		<p class="info">The last category that can earn points is exercise minutes. This category accounts for any type of exercise, from following along with a workout video to taking a walk around your neighborhood. </p>

		<table>
			<caption>Point Breakdown for Distance Week</caption>
			<tr>
				<th>Category</th>
				<th>Requirements for One Point</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Distance on Foot</td>
				<td>1/3 km</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Distance Biking</td>
				<td>0.5 km</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Exercise Minutes</td>
				<td>30 minutes</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
		<p class="info">You should input your distance traveled and your exercise minutes directly into your team's spreadsheet as shown in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q1sKxuTI65bQeSO4C1nCZ4pjUsaJkJ8WK6rtLTzQm0s/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Exemplar</a>. Please enter distances in km and omit writing the units. Remember that your workouts can count for more than one category. If you do a 30-minute workout that includes 5 km of jogging outdoors you would earn 16 points for your team (5 x 3 points for the distance on foot x 2 for traveling outdoors + 1 point for the 30 minutes of exercise).</p>
